            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h2>Personal Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Hi everyone, my name is Yahya Ara. I am 18 and I study Computer Engineering at Istanbul Technical University.
            </p>

            <h2>Academic Interests</h2>
            <p>I have two primary interests: Computers and Math.</p>
            <p>
                My interest in computers dates back to my chilhood and is mostly a result of my interest in video games. When I was around 4-5 years old 
                I started playing computer games with my fellow pre-school friends. These were mostly online games from websites like <a href="https://www.friv.com/">Friv</a> 
                or <a href="https://www.oyunskor.com/">Oyun Skor</a>. Then, with the occasion of my father, I started playing more<i>advanced</i> games
                like Age of Empires III. After a while, around middle school, I had the perfect idea that I could create my own video game. So I looked into 
                game dev for children I found Scratch by MIT. I immediately got hooked to it and created all sorts of games and animations using the tools I was given.
                However, around 7th grade I realised that unfortunately Scratch was insufficient for my dreams to come true so I decided to learn something 
                more eligible for actual video game development where I settled on Unity. I learned C# and followed tutorials made by the legendary 
                YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYbK_tjZ2OrIZFBvU6CCMiA">Brackeys</a>. Then the pandemic happened which caused a major setback
                in my game dev learning progress because instead of learning to make video games and being productive I just sat at home and played Valorant
                which triggered my eventual disillusionment with video games. Nowadays, although I haven't dropped playing video games
                I mostly play games with my friends as a means of socialistion. Nonetheless, my interest in computers outweighted my interest in gaming 
                and I am still very much interested in software development in general (not necessarily game dev).
            </p>

            <p>
                My interest in math however is much more recent. During  primary education I mostly viewed math as a subject and didn't think much of it. In high 
                school because I didn't study and mostly played games I got low marks from math so I thought I was quite bad at math and started to hate it slightly.
                However around 12th grade I had an academic epiphany and realised that I was thinking about math wrong this whole time. Beneath the fact that
                math was a school, a whole lot of interesting phenomena was hidden. I started appreciate the abstract nature and the certainty associated with
                mathematics. I am currently undecided about what I exactly should do with this interest. I might pursue academic math in the future but for the
                time being I think I will just keep it as a hobby.
